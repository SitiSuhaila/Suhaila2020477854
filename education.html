<p style="text-align: center; font-style: italic;"> My school, SMK Pulau Nyior

<div class="layout">
    <p> In terms of educational background, I was studied in <abbr title="Sekolah Menengah Kebangsaan">SMK</abbr> Pulau Nyior, few meters away from my home in Jitra, Kedah during my 
        secondary years since 2015 till 2019. It was good times to be friend with lot of friends from different classes and clubs. Interestingly, I was a prefect back then
        started from Form 1 to Form 5.</p>
    
    
    <p> During Form 5, I took Accounting class which required me to learn Accounting, Additional Mathematics and Science Computer. Despite the struggles in scoring A's for the subjects, I had to admit 
        that each of the learning session for the subjects were fun and interesting. Not too mention the beloved teachers who teached us. Kudos to them! (read: Cikgu Haliza, Cikgu Rohasnita and
        Cikgu Bashariah and other teachers as well, you know who you are). Alhamdulillah, due to efforts and prayers not only from myself but also from everyone else, I managed to get good results
        for my <abbr title="Sijil Pelajaran Malaysia">SPM</abbr> (read: 5A 2B 1C 1E).</p>

    <p> After done with SPM, I decided to continue my studies for Diploma in Information Management in Universiti Teknologi Mara (UiTM) 
        Cawangan Kedah. The course contains lots of new knowledge which I've never known. I've learned lot about the literacy skills in finding
        accurate information, accessing various databases to get different types of materials such as journal articles and books and most interestingly, designing posters, ebook
        as well as websites. There also courses that focuses on information agencies such as archives and library. All of these not only enables me to be more knowledgeable in this 
        field but also give me reasons to decide on my career path in the future. </p>  
    
    <p> As IM student that currently in final year, I feel a bit of nervous yet excited to end my diploma years with the best results. Sometimes, it feel surreal to know that I literally 
        have been studied for over 2 years since 2020. After so many ups and downs, sleepless nights and so on, this is the last time for me and my friends to show our efforts best out 
        of best. To be honest, I just hope that each one of us will achieve dreams we've been dreaming before no matter how hard it is. May Allah ease everything for us, InsyaAllah.  &#127774; </p>
